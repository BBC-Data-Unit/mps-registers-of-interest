In July 2017 we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40709220) that one in five MPs continue to employ a member of their family using taxpayers' money despite the practice being banned for new members of Parliament. The data was scraped from official parliamentary registers.

The story led to reactions from the Digital Policing lead for West Yorkshire Police and Executive Director of Transparency International UK, which were embedded in the piece.

## Get the data

* The data was collected from Parliament's [Register of Members' Financial Interests As at 7th July 2017](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/170707/contents.htm)
* [CSV: Employment of family by party and relationship]()
* [CSV: Percentage of each party's MPs employing family]()
* [CSV: By MP: entries under "Family members employed and paid from parliamentary expenses"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/mps-registers-of-interest/blob/master/ROI17_familyemployment070717.csv)

## Visualisation

* Bar chart: Which family members are employed by MPs?
* Bar chart: Breakdown by political party - Percentage of MPs in each party with relatives employed (added)
* Pie chart: Breakdown by political party (% of total) (removed - as different parties have different numbers of MPs in Parliament, a bar chart was felt to be a more accurate representation of the proportion of MPs)
