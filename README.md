In July 2017 we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40709220) that one in five MPs continue to employ a member of their family using taxpayers' money despite the practice being banned for new members of Parliament. The data was scraped from official parliamentary registers.

The story led to reactions from the Digital Policing lead for West Yorkshire Police and Executive Director of Transparency International UK, which were embedded in the piece.
